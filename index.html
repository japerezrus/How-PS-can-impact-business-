    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Stone, Slate, Vibrant Blue, Sky) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a two-column, interconnected dashboard structure. The left column allows users to select a metric category, then a specific metric. The right column dynamically updates to show the consultant's influence on the selected metric, including a radar chart visualizing the impact area. This structure was chosen to transform the report's linear information into an interactive cause-and-effect exploration, directly linking a business goal (the metric) to the consultant's value proposition (the influence), which is the core message of the source material. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Key business metrics and consultant roles. Goal -> Show the relationship between metrics and consultant actions. Viz/Presentation Method -> Interactive lists for metrics (HTML/Tailwind/JS) and a dynamic content panel for influence points. A Radar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is used to visually summarize which primary business area (Growth, Profitability, Experiences, Sustainability) a selected metric and the corresponding consultant actions most affect. Interaction -> User clicks a metric, the influence panel and radar chart update instantly. Justification -> This interactive model is more engaging and informative than static text, allowing users to explore the connections at their own pace. Library/Method -> Chart.js for visualization and Vanilla JS for all interactions and DOM manipulation. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
